\description{
This function runs a bacterial genome-wide association test. It
  runs either the Continuous Test (when given continuous phenotype data) or
  both the Synchronous Test and PhyC (when given binary phenotype data).
}
\details{
Overview: hogwash reads in one phenotype (either continuous or
 binary), a matrix of binary genotypes, and a phylogenetic tree. Given these
 inputs it performs an ancestral reconstruction of that phenotype and each
 genotype. The ancestral reconstructions are used to perform one of several
 tests to associate the the genotypes with the phenotype:
 \enumerate{
  \item Continuous Test
  \item Synchronous Test
  \item PhyC (Farhat et al.)
}
 Once a test finishes running it returns (i) p-values for all genotypes
 tested, (ii) a manhattan plot of those p-values; if any of the genotypes
 tested were significant associated with the phenotype after FDR correction
 it also returns (iii) a list of significant hits and (iv) figures of the
 genotype & phenotype reconstructions on the tree.

 Grouping: A feature of hogwash is the ability to organize genotypes into
 biologically meaningful groups. Testing for an association between an
 individual SNP and a phenotype is quite stringent, but patterns may emerge
 when grouping together biologically related genotypes. For example,
 grouping together all variants (insertions, deletions and SNPs) within a
 gene or promoter region could allow the user to identify a particular gene
 as being associated with a phenotype while any individual variant within
 that gene may not have deep penetrance in the isolates being tested.
 Grouped genotypes could have increased power to identify convergent
 evolution because they captures larger trends in functional impact at the
 group level and reduce the multiple testing correction burden. Use cases
 for this method could be to group SNPs into genes, kmers or genes into
 pathways, etc... Each of the three tests can be run on disaggregated data
 or aggregated data with the inclusion of a grouping key which is
 described later on the inputs page.
